<li>have custody and control of your child (or had custody and control immediately before the child turned 19 years of age) and your child is wholly dependent on that person for support</li>

<p>If you or your spouse or common‑law partner were non‑residents of Canada for&nbsp;part or all of the year, family net income includes your or your spouse’s or&nbsp;common‑law partner’s income from all sources, both inside <strong>and</strong> outside Canada, for any part of the year that either of you were not residents of&nbsp;Canada.</p>
<p><strong><a id="prcuc"></a>Primarily responsible for the care and upbringing of a child</strong> – means that you are responsible for such things as supervising the child’s daily activities and needs, making sure the child’s medical needs are met, and arranging for child care when necessary.

<p>The Canada child benefit (CCB) is a <strong>non‑taxable</strong> amount paid monthly to help eligible families with the cost of raising children under 18&nbsp;years of age. The CCB may include an additional amount for the <a href="#CCB_CDB">child disability benefit</a>.</p>

If a child does not live with you all the time, see <a href="#CCB_DYSCOAC">Do you share custody of a child?</a>.<br>

        <h3><strong><a id="sps"></a>Do you have a spouse or common-law partner?</strong></h3>
<p>For CCB purposes, when both a male and a female parent live in the same home as the child, the <strong>female parent is usually considered to be primarily responsible </strong>for the child and should apply. However, if the male parent is primarily responsible, he can apply. He must attach to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc66.html">Form RC66, Canada Child Benefits Application</a>, a signed note from the female parent that states he is primarily responsible for all of the children in the household. If your spouse or common-law partner is a person of the same sex, one of you will get the CCB for all the children.</p>
<p>If your spouse or common-law partner is a non-resident of Canada during any part of the year, you will have to fill out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/ctb9.html">Form CTB9, Canada Child Benefit – Statement of Income</a>, for each year or part of a year that they are a non-resident of Canada.</p>
<p>When your <strong>spouse immigrates </strong>to Canada, they have to send us in writing all of the following information about themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>social insurance number</li>
<li>date of birth</li>
<li>address</li>
<li>immigration date</li>
<li>statement of income</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>If you have a new spouse or common-law partner</strong></h4>
<p>When you tell us of your new married or common-law status, include your spouse’s or common-law partner’s name, address, and social insurance number. Also, we need the signatures of both you and your spouse or common-law partner.</p>
<p>Only one CCB payment is allowed per family each month. If both you and your new spouse or common-law partner were getting separate payments, only one payment will be made based on your new adjusted family net income. Generally, all the children will be moved to the female parent's account. If you continue to get separate payments, one of you will have to repay the amounts you got after your marital status changed.</p>

        <h3 id="P161_9469">How do we calculate your benefit?</h3>
<p>For the&nbsp;payment&nbsp;period of&nbsp;July 2018 to June 2019, we calculate your benefit based on all the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of&nbsp;eligible children you have and their ages</li>
<li>your <a href="#afmlynt">adjusted family net income</a> for the base year 2017</li>
<li>your child's eligibility for the disability tax credit (DTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>To continue getting the CCB, you and your spouse or common-law partner each have to file tax returns every year, even if you have not received income in the year.&nbsp;</p>




</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4>Base year and payment period</h4>
<p>The <strong>base year </strong>is the year of the tax return from which information is taken to calculate the CCB&nbsp;amount for the payment period. The base year is the calendar year just before the start of the payment period.</p>
<p>The <strong>payment period </strong>is the 12-month period during which the CCB payments are paid. The payment period runs from July 1 of the year following the base year to June 30 of the next year. For example, CCB payments calculated based on the 2017 tax return will start being issued in July 2018, which is the beginning of the payment period. For more information, see <a href="#pybnft">When do we pay your benefit?</a>.</p>

<li>$6,496 per year ($541.33 per month) for each eligible child under the age of six<br>
</li>
<li>$5,481 per year ($456.75 per month) for each eligible child aged 6 to 17</li>

<p>These amounts start being reduced when the adjusted family net income (AFNI) is over $30,450. The reduction is calculated as follows:</p>

<li>for families with <strong>2 </strong>eligible children, the reduction is 13.5% of the amount of AFNI between $30,450 and $65,975, plus 5.7% of the amount of AFNI over $65,975</li>

<p>The child disability benefit (CDB) is an additional monthly benefit included in the CCB to provide financial assistance to qualified families caring for children who have a severe and prolonged impairment in physical or mental functions. If you have a child under 18 years of age who is eligible for the DTC, you are eligible for the CDB.</p>
<p>A child is eligible for the DTC when we have approved <a>Form T2201, Disability Tax Credit Certificate</a>, for that child.

<p>The CDB provides up to $2,771 per year ($230.91 per month) for each child eligible for the DTC. The CDB starts being reduced when the adjusted family net income (AFNI) is more than $65,975. The reduction is calculated as follows:</p>
