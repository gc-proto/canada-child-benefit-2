## Canada Child Benefit optimization project with CRA

A collaboration between TBS Digital Transformation Office and Canada Revenue Agency

__Outcome we are working towards: Sign in Canada and mobile optimized design for Canada Child Benefit__

This repo holds a prototype of a new task-based design for Canada Child Benefit to improve citizen success signing in to My Account and on mobile devices. The targets for this project are to improve user success by at least 20 percentage points at finding their answers to Canada Child Benefit tasks.

A baseline round of task-scenario testing on the live version of Canada.ca as well as the baseline repo which holds a dummy CRA My Account to observe tasks where Canadians sign in. The behaviour of the parents in the study, may from low-income brackets, will highlight critical usability problems.

Working together as a collaborative team across the departments, we will design and implement solutions in the prototype pages. A second round of validation testing with a different set of Canadian participants was conducted in the summer. Participants in that study will only use the prototype rather than the live site and dummy account, to test that the success rates are improved. Since then, some fine tuning and building out of the pages has been done and the tested version has been archived.
